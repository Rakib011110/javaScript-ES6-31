- Template strings, also known as template literals, are a feature in JavaScript that allows for more expressive and flexible string formatting. Template strings are enclosed in backticks (``) instead of single quotes or double quotes.

- One of the key features of template strings is the ability to embed expressions directly into the string, using the ${expression} syntax. This allows for more dynamic string formatting, where the value of the expression is automatically converted to a string and inserted into the string.

```js
const name = "Rakib";
const age = 25;
const message = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
```
